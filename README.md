# Decorators-and-Generators-in-Python
Understanding decorators and generators is crucial for any Python programmer aiming to write efficient, scalable, and maintainable code. These features are not only used to enhance code functionality but also to improve performance and resource management.  
Decorators provide a means to extend and modify behavior without altering existing code, promoting code reuse and separation of concerns. 
Generators, on the other hand, offer a memory-efficient way to handle large datasets and perform iterative operations.
